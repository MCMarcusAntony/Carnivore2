--------------------------------------------------

30.09.2018

1. The Casio's built-in trigger buttons can now interrupt the autostart


22.09.2018

1. The boot block now supports joypads and joysticks connected to any of the 2 joystick ports.
   They allow to control the cursor in the main menu, start the games and configuration entries
   and also to stop the autostart of the selected entry

2. Added the second help screen with the description of joystick's actions into the boot block.
   The autostart message now mentions joystick's action as well


14.06.2018 (firmware update is required)

1. The PSG emulation was re-worked, not it sounds very close to the original chip's output

2. All tools now work correctly under MSX-DOS version 1.xx; The C2MAN_40.COM utility has been
   renamed to C2MAN40.COM for compatibility with older DOS versions

3. The code of C2MAN and C2MAN40 utilities was merged and can be now compiled from one file,
   the VDP and MSX generation detection allows to set correct mode depending on the platform;
   the user interface has been improved, the code was optimized

4. In the \Util\special subfolder there are special versions of the C2MAN and C2MAN40 utilities,
   whose directory editor works correctly on Korean and Arabic MSX computers

5. The C2BACKUP tool is now writing to FlashROM 35% faster, the counter bug is fixed

6. The SCC and PSG filters were optimized in the firmware, the sound quality is much improved

7. The Altera's firmware now has the hardware-based interceptor for starting ROM images, but
   this feature is not yet used in the boot block

8. The /r restart option is now supported by C2BACKUP and C2SRAM utilities


10.05.2018

1. The tools and the boot block now work on Daewoo and Arabic MSX computers

2. The new tool is available - C2BACKUP: it allows to read and write the contents of the entire
   FlashROM chip


06.05.2018

1. Fixed a bug with help output in all utilities

2. Added reboot functionality into C2MAN and C2MAN_40 utilities


29.04.2018 (firmware update is highly recommended)

1. Added Z80/R800 mode toggle for Turbo-R machines with 'T' button

2. Added Turbo mode toggle for Panasonic MSX2+ machines with 'T' button

3. Added indication of Z80/Turbo/R800 mode to the status screen

4. The CF card's clock speed is now independent from the CPU's clock speed. So the IDE will work correctly
   even if the CPU speed is above normal. Also a few minor errors in the firmware were fixed

5. The selected VDP frequency and/or Turbo/R800 mode is preserved for ROMs after system restart

6. Corrections were made into the documentation regarding the PosSiz register and the Turbo/R800 modes

7. When an RCP file with the same name as ROM file is found, the C2MAN, C2MAN40 and C2RAMLDR utilities
   are asking whether to load the RCP data. In autoloading mode the RCP data is loaded automatically

8. The C2RAMLDR utility can now reset the computer on-demand or automatically after loading the ROM file
   if the /r command line option is used; the restart option has been added into the menu

9. After writing IDE or FMPAC BIOS into the cartridge there's no longer a problem with directory editing.
   In the past the directory was shown as corrupted because of incorrect configuration after BIOS flashing.

10. A few RCP files have been added


03.02.2018

1. Fixed an error in the directory record deletion dialog in the C2MAN and C2MAN_40 utilities

2. A few RCP files have been added


03.01.2018

1. Fixed the incorrect value for Konami 4 mapper configuration


30.12.2017

1. Modified C2MAN, C2MAN_40, C2RAMLDR and C2SRAM utilities for case-insensitive input


26.12.2017

1. Slightly improved font and volume indicators in the boot block

2. Improved presets DSK2ROM and LIFEMARS


16.12.2017

1. Fixed a bug in C2MAN, C2MAN_40 and C2RAMLDR utilities - when the reset was selected for a ROM, the second
   reset flag was not set in configuration registers, that led to a conflict

2. Improved font for boot block, changed a few symbols, added horizontal lines after screen titles


05.12.2017 (firmware update is required)

1. Fixed the attribute correction bug in C2MAN, C2MAN_40 and C2RAMLDR utilities. Now files with all attributes
   are read correctly

2. The firmware now supports enabling or disabling the internal PSG and PPI Clicker devices and setting the
   volumes for both of them

3. The boot block was updated to support PSG and PPI enabling/disabling as well as setting the volumes for
   both devices

4. The boot block is now also available in red color scheme


16.11.2017

1. When autostart is set on any entry, after reboot there will be a note shown and there will be a 3 second
   delay before this entry is activated. During these 3 seconds a user can abort autostart

2. Now the entry can be started with default settings by using Enter key in addition to Space

3. You no longer need to press Shift in boot block to do some action. Both upper and lower case characters are
   accepted and action is taken regardles of the case

4. The help screen was updated with the changes (keys assignments) and it now shows the boot block's version
   number. Thanks to 8bits4ever for the idea!

5. Fixed a bug: now the configuration entries can't be started with G/g key

6. Fixed a bug: the C2RAMLDR utility was showing incorrect error message when copying a file to cartridge's RAM
   was failing

7. The C2RAMLDR utility no longer puts "R" into the mapper field for the "RAM: name" entries, now the detected or
   manually selected mapper type is put there

8. The C2RAMLDR utility can be instructed to skip the creation of a directory entry with /D option or during the
   user interaction
 
9. The C2SRAM utility has been created for saving and loading the contents of the emulated SRAM area for the
   FMPAC device



04.11.2017

1. The cursor is completely removed (thanks to Grauw and Nyyrikki), mapper symbols have been changed and improved,
   help and volume control screens were slightly changed (a line was added to the bottom)

2. The C2MAN_40 utility now sets the 40 symbol screen width when started. The C2MAN utility has been updated to
   detect the VDP and show a note if it's started in screen mode with less than 80 symbols witdth. This note
   is skipped when the command line is not empty to allow automatic flashing mode to work without user interaction


03.11.2017

1. The font has been updated so that the status line is not touching the border. A few new symbols were added:
   copyright sign, 'V' and 'H' key symbols. The selection marker has been changed to a better one

2. The colors and palette for the main, help and volume screens have been moved to variables. Now you can easily
   compile yourself a custom color scheme boot block without much hassle

3. An attempt was made to remove the cursor. Also the key click sound was disabled

4. The main, help and volume screens on MSX1 now look similar to those on MSX2, the colors have been changed to
   match those on MSX2


22.10.2017

1. The schematics has been changed. The part numbers of T3-T6 transistors were incorrect there. This doesn't
   affect the device, it's just a cosmetic bug


02.10.2017

1. Now the VDP frequency can be changed between 50 and 60 Herz with the "F" key in the main menu. The setting is
   saved into an additional configuration EEPROM

2. The status line has been added to the bottom of the main screen. It shows the current VDP frequency, FMPAC
   and SCC volume as well as the current directory page vs. total number of pages


13.09.2017 (firmware update is required)

1. The volume of FMPAC and SCC can be now saved into the additional configuration EEPROM on board. The change
   requires updating the firmware and boot block


02.09.2017 (firmware update is required)

1. The DAC output has been drastically improved. The sound of FMPAC is way better now. The change requires
   updating the firmware and boot block

2. The volume of SCC and FMPAC can now be controlled from the boot block

3. SCC+ support has been added

4. Fixed a bug with video effects on MSX1. The palette effects on VDPs earlier than v9938 have been disabled


10.02.2017  (firmware update is required)

1. The function of the register configuration for slot expansion has been improved. Also a check was added to
   prevent illegal values to be saved into this register


2. All configuration registers are now visible at addresses 4F80h-4FA1h. This is done for easier debugging.
   These registers can be changed on-the-fly and the changes will be immediately taken into action


03.02.2017 (firmware update is required)

1. The expanded slot functionality has been added. Please refer to the cartridge's documentation for more info
