--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.03.2020 (required updates: FPGA firmware, Boot Menu, all utilities, DefConfig entry;
           the "Power-up fix" must be removed if it was implemented on board!)

1. The new setup screen was introduced - slot configuration. It can be called with "O" hotkey or
   with "Enter". The new setup screen allows to run dual-slot configuration with flexible
   options selection for the master slot (you can choose what Carnivore2 built-in devices to
   enable). You can select 2 ROMs to run simultaneously. The only restriction for the slave slot
   is that it can run games with Konami4 and Konami5 mappers as well as small games up to 32kb
   without mapper. The slave slot becomes available if there's one unused physical slot in MSX
   and it is not occupied by another device

2. The Boot Menu main page's UI was adjusted to have all main hotkeys easily visible. Also the
   Boot Menu now has the visible selection for master and slave slots called "Dual-Slot". The
   entry for the master slot can be selected by pressing "1", the entry for the slave slot can be
   selected by pressing "2". The "D" key clears the selection as well as Autostart entry

3. The DefConfig's settings were changed and the Boot Menu was adjusted so that when this default
   configuration is started, the Boot Menu remains in the primary slot, allows the system to
   start and is always detectable by C2MAN and other utilities. The C2MAN and C2MAN40 utilities
   now write the adjusted DefConfig entry into the directory when you optimize directory entries
   from the Service Menu

4. A new setting has been added into the Configuration screen to set the desired frequency at
   startup. A user can choose between 50Hz, 60Hz and the default computer's frequency (no forcing,
   this is marked as "--"). The setting is saved into the configuration EEPROM. Now the "F" button
   in the Boot Menu only temporarily switches the frequency between 50Hz and 60Hz

5. The Configuration screen got yet another new setting - "Dual-reset on cold boot". It makes the
   computer restart twice after the cold boot. This is necessary to make sure that the cartridge
   is fully initialized when a computer is just powered on. So it is recommended to enable the
   dual-reset feature

6. The C2CFGBCK utility no longer does the BIOS ROM shadowing and therefore starts faster

7. The Boot Menu's data section has been heavily optimized to have space for more features. The
   repeated characters are now output with a macros (this saves space). The data for Boot Menu's
   screens is now written in the last two 8kb blocks of the first 64kb FlashROM block. This
   saves a lot of space

8. The firmware now reports its internal version in the configuration registers (3 bytes) in
   ASCII format (only starting from v2.30)

9. The cartridge now outputs the actual versions of the Boot Menu and the firmware during the
   cold boot and then either reboots a system again (dual-reset) or continues to the Boot Menu

10. The cartridge will not work in slot 0 and slot 3, it will output a message and halt a
    system if it detects that it's used in those slots

11. The IDE BIOS has been changed to Nextor 2.1.0 Beta 2. This is a stable version with many
    bugfixes and new features provided by Konamiman

12. The Configuration screen got another new setting - "Disable FMPAC stereo". It disables the
    stereo output of FMPAC from Carnivore2's audio socket

13. The Boot Menu now detects that it is running on Korean or Arabic MSXs and in case it is
    not compatible with those systems, it will output a message and will try to boot to DOS
    after 10 seconds. In such a case a compatible Boot Menu (BOOTCMFC.BIN) should be installed
    into the cartridge (see the "Special" subfolder in the repository for the compatible
    version of the Boot Menu

14. ROMs can be selected with the "Space" key in the Dual-Slot screen. Pressing space will
    allow to cycle through compatible ROMs for each slot. After the full cycle there will be an
    "empty" selection to keep the slot vacant. In addition, the master slot can also use the
    "Konami SCC+" configuration. So you can run SCC+ games in the slave slot and enjoy SCC+
    and a game on a single cartridge. When the master slot's expansion is enabled, any of
    its devices (RAM, FMPAC, IDE) can be enabled or disabled with the "Space" key

15. The autostart countdown can be skipped with "Space" key. The same applies to the message
    about the incompatible Boot Menu

16. All screens now support joystick. The joystick's directions are interpreted as cursor
    keys and the buttons are interpreted as "Space" or "ESC". Please see the readme.txt for
    more info

17. In the PSG/PPI settings the "Space" key now enables or disables the PSG and the "Enter"
    key enables or disables the PPI clicker. This is done to better support joystick usage
    in this screen

18. During the autostart countdown joystick buttons allow to either skip the countdown and
    start an entry or to cancel the countdown and go to the main menu. Please see the
    readme.txt for more info

19. The Boot Menu detects Russian network modules and halts a system to prevent conflicts


31.03.2019

1. Added UI settings screen that can be called with "S" button into the Boot Menu. A user can
   now enable sorting of the menu entries, enable/disable fade in/out effects, set the speed
   of the keyboard/joystick and customize the font and the background colors of all Boot Menu's
   screens (on MSX2 and later computers). A user can also restore the default settings with
   just one button. The UI settings are stored in the configuration EEPROM

2. The F3 key loads the UI defaults on startup, but it doesn't clear the settings in the EEPROM.
   This function may be used to bypass bad configuration settings

3. The C2MAN, C2MAN40, C2RAMLDR, C2SRAM and C2BACKUP utilities now assume the default extension
   for their data files and ROM images if a user doesn't input the extension himself

4. The C2MAN, C2MAN40 and C2RAMLDR utilities got a bugfix to better identify the free directory
   entries in order to re-use them. The directory optimization now works better

5. The C2MAN and C2MAN40 utilities were optimized in size to better fit into RAM under MSX-DOS2

6. The new utility C2CFGBCK allows to backup and restore the data in the configuration EEPROM

7. The C2BACKUP utility asks a user whether he wants to preserve the existing Boot Menu on the
   cartridge and in case of a positive answer it doesn't overwrite the existing Boot Menu with
   the one stored in the backup file

8. Added C2IDETST utility to test IDE controller's functionality. The utility performs 16384
   read/write operations and shows the status for each of them. In the end the utility shows the
   total/success/failed counters


30.09.2018

1. The Casio's built-in trigger buttons can now interrupt the autostart


22.09.2018

1. The Boot Menu now supports joypads and joysticks connected to any of the 2 joystick ports.
   They allow to control the cursor in the main menu, start the games and configuration entries
   and also to stop the autostart of the selected entry

2. Added the second help screen with the description of joystick's actions into the Boot Menu.
   The autostart message now mentions joystick's action as well


14.06.2018 (firmware update is required)

1. The PSG emulation was re-worked, not it sounds very close to the original chip's output

2. All tools now work correctly under MSX-DOS version 1.xx; The C2MAN_40.COM utility has been
   renamed to C2MAN40.COM for compatibility with older DOS versions

3. The code of C2MAN and C2MAN40 utilities was merged and can be now compiled from one file,
   the VDP and MSX generation detection allows to set correct mode depending on the platform;
   the user interface has been improved, the code was optimized

4. In the \Util\special subfolder there are special versions of the C2MAN and C2MAN40 utilities,
   whose directory editor works correctly on Korean and Arabic MSX computers

5. The C2BACKUP tool is now writing to FlashROM 35% faster, the counter bug is fixed

6. The SCC and PSG filters were optimized in the firmware, the sound quality is much improved

7. The Altera's firmware now has the hardware-based interceptor for starting ROM images, but
   this feature is not yet used in the Boot Menu

8. The /r restart option is now supported by C2BACKUP and C2SRAM utilities


10.05.2018

1. The tools and the Boot Menu now work on Daewoo and Arabic MSX computers

2. The new tool is available - C2BACKUP: it allows to read and write the contents of the entire
   FlashROM chip


06.05.2018

1. Fixed a bug with help output in all utilities

2. Added reboot functionality into C2MAN and C2MAN_40 utilities


29.04.2018 (firmware update is highly recommended)

1. Added Z80/R800 mode toggle for Turbo-R machines with 'T' button

2. Added Turbo mode toggle for Panasonic MSX2+ machines with 'T' button

3. Added indication of Z80/Turbo/R800 mode to the status screen

4. The CF card's clock speed is now independent from the CPU's clock speed. So the IDE will work correctly
   even if the CPU speed is above normal. Also a few minor errors in the firmware were fixed

5. The selected VDP frequency and/or Turbo/R800 mode is preserved for ROMs after system restart

6. Corrections were made into the documentation regarding the PosSiz register and the Turbo/R800 modes

7. When an RCP file with the same name as ROM file is found, the C2MAN, C2MAN40 and C2RAMLDR utilities
   are asking whether to load the RCP data. In autoloading mode the RCP data is loaded automatically

8. The C2RAMLDR utility can now reset the computer on-demand or automatically after loading the ROM file
   if the /r command line option is used; the restart option has been added into the menu

9. After writing IDE or FMPAC BIOS into the cartridge there's no longer a problem with directory editing.
   In the past the directory was shown as corrupted because of incorrect configuration after BIOS flashing.

10. A few RCP files have been added


03.02.2018

1. Fixed an error in the directory record deletion dialog in the C2MAN and C2MAN_40 utilities

2. A few RCP files have been added

   reset flag was not set in configuration registers, that led to a conflict

2. Improved font for Boot Menu, changed a few symbols, added horizontal lines after screen titles


05.12.2017 (firmware update is required)

1. Fixed the attribute correction bug in C2MAN, C2MAN_40 and C2RAMLDR utilities. Now files with all attributes
   are read correctly

3. The Boot Menu was updated to support PSG and PPI enabling/disabling as well as setting the volumes for
   both devices

4. The Boot Menu is now also available in red color scheme


16.11.2017

1. When autostart is set on any entry, after reboot there will be a note shown and there will be a 3 second
   delay before this entry is activated. During these 3 seconds a user can abort autostart

2. Now the entry can be started with default settings by using Enter key in addition to Space

3. You no longer need to press Shift in Boot Menu to do some action. Both upper and lower case characters are
   accepted and action is taken regardles of the case

4. The help screen was updated with the changes (keys assignments) and it now shows the Boot Menu's version
   number. Thanks to 8bits4ever for the idea!

5. Fixed a bug: now the configuration entries can't be started with G/g key

6. Fixed a bug: the C2RAMLDR utility was showing incorrect error message when copying a file to cartridge's RAM
   was failing

7. The C2RAMLDR utility no longer puts "R" into the mapper field for the "RAM: name" entries, now the detected or
   manually selected mapper type is put there

8. The C2RAMLDR utility can be instructed to skip the creation of a directory entry with /D option or during the
   user interaction
 
9. The C2SRAM utility has been created for saving and loading the contents of the emulated SRAM area for the
   FMPAC device



04.11.2017

1. The cursor is completely removed (thanks to Grauw and Nyyrikki), mapper symbols have been changed and improved,
   help and volume control screens were slightly changed (a line was added to the bottom)

2. The C2MAN_40 utility now sets the 40 symbol screen width when started. The C2MAN utility has been updated to
   detect the VDP and show a note if it's started in screen mode with less than 80 symbols witdth. This note
   is skipped when the command line is not empty to allow automatic flashing mode to work without user interaction


03.11.2017

1. The font has been updated so that the status line is not touching the border. A few new symbols were added:
   copyright sign, 'V' and 'H' key symbols. The selection marker has been changed to a better one

2. The colors and palette for the main, help and volume screens have been moved to variables. Now you can easily
   compile yourself a custom color scheme Boot Menu without much hassle

3. An attempt was made to remove the cursor. Also the key click sound was disabled

4. The main, help and volume screens on MSX1 now look similar to those on MSX2, the colors have been changed to
   match those on MSX2


22.10.2017

1. The schematics has been changed. The part numbers of T3-T6 transistors were incorrect there. This doesn't
   affect the device, it's just a cosmetic bug


02.10.2017

1. Now the VDP frequency can be changed between 50 and 60 Herz with the "F" key in the main menu. The setting is
   saved into an additional configuration EEPROM

2. The status line has been added to the bottom of the main screen. It shows the current VDP frequency, FMPAC
   and SCC volume as well as the current directory page vs. total number of pages


13.09.2017 (firmware update is required)

1. The volume of FMPAC and SCC can be now saved into the additional configuration EEPROM on board. The change
   requires updating the firmware and Boot Menu


02.09.2017 (firmware update is required)

1. The DAC output has been drastically improved. The sound of FMPAC is way better now. The change requires
   updating the firmware and Boot Menu

2. The volume of SCC and FMPAC can now be controlled from the Boot Menu

3. SCC+ support has been added

4. Fixed a bug with video effects on MSX1. The palette effects on VDPs earlier than v9938 have been disabled


10.02.2017  (firmware update is required)

1. The function of the register configuration for slot expansion has been improved. Also a check was added to
   prevent illegal values to be saved into this register


2. All configuration registers are now visible at addresses 4F80h-4FA1h. This is done for easier debugging.
   These registers can be changed on-the-fly and the changes will be immediately taken into action


03.02.2017 (firmware update is required)

1. The expanded slot functionality has been added. Please refer to the cartridge's documentation for more info
