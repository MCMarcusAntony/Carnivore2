Last minute notes
-----------------

The dual-slot functionality doesn't work on at least 2 computers: Sony HB-55 and HB-75. The reason is still unknown. We hope to
mitigate this issue in the future versions of Boot Meny, when the subslot is invoked in the dual-slot emulation functionality.
Certain subslot combinations may not work well on MSX TurboR computers. We will try to fix this as well.

When a computer is just powered on with the Carnivore2 cartridge inserted into a slot, it will reboot twice. This is normal and
was implemented to make sure that the cartridge is fully initialized after the cold boot. You can enable the dual-reboot feature
in the Configuration settings.
