OpenMSX supports the emulation of the Carnivore2 cartridge since build 0_14_0-200:

https://openmsx.vampier.net

These files are necessary to support emulation of Carnivore2 in OpenMSX emulator. The
files must be put into the "\share\extensions" subfolder of the emulator and then the
configuration needs to be refreshed to get "Carnivore2" device in the emulator's GUI.

Please update the boot block and tools once you get the Carnivore2 setup working in
OpenMSX. The boot block and tools can be downloaded from RBSC's repository.
